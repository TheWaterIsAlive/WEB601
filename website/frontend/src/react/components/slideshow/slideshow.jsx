            Alfie could put anything on a pizza and make it taste fabulous, I
            swear he could. There were the days he pulled a plain cheese from
            the oven just to make us laugh, but most days it was an edible form
            of his crazy wonderful imagination. It was the thing we looked
            forward to the most after our day. Nothing surprises us anymore, but
            we're still amazed each time supper comes around.

            Sasha tool a bite of the omlette, cheesy with dark leafy greens. She
            smiled, "Tamal, that's so good, what's the green stuff?" With a
            boyish grin he raised his brows, opening up his eyes, "Stinging
            nettle, chives and dandelion leaves." Sasha paused as if her
            thoughts had stopped entirely, "Holy. That tastes good." He gave a
            shrug, the one he always gave when he was proud of himself but
            tickled with his own shyness. "Chuck out the stems from the
            dandelions, boil the rest together for a few minutes, cold water,
            squeeze, chop. That's it. Sting all gone. Eat what wants to grow,
            easy."

            But the real star is the food. Tables laden with delicacies line the
            walls. Everything you can think of, and things you have never
            dreamed of, lie in wait. Whole roasted cows and pigs and goats still
            turning on spits. Huge platters of fowl stuffed with savoury fruit
            and nuts. Ocean creatures drizzled in sauces or begging to be dipped
            in spicy concoctions. Countless cheeses, breads, vegetables, sweets,
            waterfalls of wine, and streams of spirits that flicker with flames.
