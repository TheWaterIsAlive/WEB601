For the first class of this week were disscused the differen types of frame works and markup langauges their are and how
popular they are. This is both interesting and important as i might want to pick langauges which are popular or in high demand.

We also disscused basic JS funtions, they are simlar to other programming langauges, just like other langauges JS has it's own differences
for example number is less regid than in other langauges. This sort of thing is important as all langauges has their own syntac and
understanding that is key to understanding the langauges.

Were also covered equal and not equal statements in JS we use === or !== for java script which is different from other programing
langauges which just use == and !=.


For the second leson we talked about the differences between if statements and switch statements.

The operator || is JS verson of or which is usefull to know as I have a tendance to create large complex and or statments.
Is is important to combin statements like this or you would need to create many nested statements which is one of the first things
I learnt I wasn't meant to do when starting this corse.

I don't realy understand arrow funtions but I will look into it as it seems important to be able to prevent errors in my code so I
Should look into it latter.


Funtions in JS are very simlar to what I am use to and are called simlarly to MySQL funtions. I should look for some differences 
SO That I don't make error or increct assumtions.
